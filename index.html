        <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Nafagha and I'm from Delta State, Nigeria. I enjoy spending time with my family,
        taking my dog for walks, going to the gym, and hanging out with a few close friends. I've always wanted
        to master web development skills, and it has been a great experience being part of this course. I believe
        this journey will help me grow and learn even better.
