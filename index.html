            <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Nafagha and I'm from Delta State, Nigeria. I enjoy spending time with my family,
                taking my dog for walks, going to the gym, and hanging out with a few close friends. I've always wanted
                to master web development skills, and it has been a great experience being part of this course. I
                believe
                this journey will help me grow and learn even better.
            </p>
